    <p>It was a dark and stormy night and it was raining heavily. There was a old house in the middle of a forest.<br>
        An old couple live there. <br></br> On that stormy night there was a deer calf that was all wet in the forest and she was out side the house.<br></br>
    seeking shelter, the deer calf took residence in their shed. While not the warmest place to stay, it at least provided cover from the rain.</p>
